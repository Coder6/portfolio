                        Hi, my name is Roshni Vakil!    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a junior attending Dublin High School. I find engineering to be very logical. That is what makes it beautiful. It is governed by rules just like math is, and in physical engineering, the result is tangible. Although I did not personally begin any engineering-related endeavors until 9th grade, the presence of engineering in my life has been eternally palpable. I grew up in a household with both of my parents working as engineers, and for as long as I can remember, I have deeply loved Disney Animated movies. I wanted to be an animator for a significant portion of my life. That desire was what brought me to engineering. During my freshman year in high school, I decided to sign up for Dublin High School’s robotics club, Gael Force Robotics (GFR), and take the course Computer Science/Software Engineering (CSE).

                        CSE was a rigorous course that introduced me to the basics of coding and made me fluent in HTML, CSS and Python. We did numerous fascinating projects (some of which are detailed in the projects section of this portfolio). Each of them strengthened my preexisting appreciation for logic. I learned that coding is not at all as abstract or as complicated as I had believed. It was very, very fun! The flexibility of this introductory course allowed my projects to stretch as far as my imagination would let me. A long as I fulfilled the basic criteria, I could program whatever I wanted. And I truly enjoyed having that free creative will, although the class itself was very intense for the novice that I was. At the end of the school year, I earned a spot in our school’s Engineering Academy under the computer science pathway.

                        My first year robotics experience left me feeling a bit more ambivalent. I started out as a member on the development team, but even so it was initially incredibly daunting. Unlike myself, most of my teammates had participated in FIRST Lego League robotics in middle school. They were significantly more knowledgeable than I was. I was also one of only five girls in the entire club of over thirty students. However, I remained persistent. The development team taught me plenty of basic engineering principles, as well the importance of effective communication and teamwork. Then, in my sophomore year I was offered an internship on a competition team. After one month of being an intern, I became an official member of team 5327C. On this team, I found a mentor in a teammate whose patience and clarity when explaining concepts made me appreciate the logic and creativity of design. Their passion for robotics sparked my own. Now, as a junior, I am a proud member of team 5327R. I serve as both a builder and as head programmer. When I can, I also try to make the time after school to mentor incoming robotics club members. I wish to pay forward the aid that was provided to me in my sophomore year. Ultimately, my entire robotics experience has shaped a significant portion of who I am today. It made me realize that although a situation may seem initially daunting, with practice and hard work any barrier can be overcome. And that is the mindset that I intend to carry with me through life.                    </p>
