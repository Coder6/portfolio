                                I wish to pursue a career in Computer Science. For as long as I can remember, engineering has been my passion. I grew up with a natural flair for logic and math in a household where both of my parents worked as engineers. Their work inspired me. In addition, Disney animated movies greatly influenced me. I have always found the art of animation fascinating, and I hope that by combining my passions I will grow to become either a software engineer or a 3D animator in the future. I want to help put smiles on children’s faces as Disney animated movies did for me. To aid myself, I plan on taking as many engineering courses as possible throughout the remainder of my high school career. The two that I have already taken not only greatly interested me, but also did a great deal to broaden my knowledge.

                                During my freshman year in high school, I took the Project Lead the Way course -- Computer Science/Software Engineering and worked diligently to earn an A grade in both semesters. It was a very rigorous class that introduced me to the basics of coding and made me fluent in HTML, CSS and Python. For the final project, we were instructed to form a group and act as entrepreneurs. Our task was to design a product that we would pitch to our classmates. The top three teams would then move on to participate in our school’s annual Entrepreneur Competition & Showcase. In our class, my group placed third for our Water Alarm. We prototyped a faucet leakage detector. It would emit audible noises when it detected water flowing out for an excessive period of time. I programmed the device. My passion and interest in engineering earned me a spot in our school’s engineering academy. The academy provides mentorship opportunities to us in our junior year and priority into engineering classes and field trips. This year I am enrolled in the Project Lead the Way course -- Principles of Engineering. My experience continues to be just as enjoyable. As a self-motivated learner, I also attended a Digital Art class at Mission College during the summer to get a taste of the basics of animation.

                                In addition to these classes, during my freshman year I joined my school’s VEX Robotics Club: Gael Force Robotics. I started out as a member on the development team, but even so it was initially incredibly daunting. Unlike myself, most of my teammates had participated in FIRST Lego League robotics in middle school. Initially, they were significantly more knowledgeable that I was. I was also one of only five girls in the entire club of over thirty students. However, I remained persistent and grew substantially as an engineer. The development team taught me plenty of basic engineering principles, as well the importance of effective communication and teamwork. In my sophomore year I was offered an internship on a competition team. After one month of being an intern, I became an official member of Team 5327C. Together, we qualified to compete at the 2018 World Championship where we placed 11th in the qualification rounds and were selected to be part of the 8th seed alliance. My entire robotics experience has helped me realize that although a task may seem initially daunting, with practice and hard work any barrier can be overcome. That is the mindset that I bring with me to any difficulty I am confronted with.
