                                I wish to pursue a career in Computer Science. For as long as I can 
                                remember, engineering as a whole has been my passion. I grew up with a 
                                natural flair for logic and math and in a household with both of my 
                                parents working as engineers. I found that their work inspired me. In 
                                addition, Disney animated movies were a huge, influential force in my 
                                life. The art of animation has always fascinated me. I hope that by 
                                combining my passions I will grow to become a software engineer or a 3D
                                animator in the future. I want to help put smiles on children’s faces 
                                as Disney animated movies did for me. To aid myself, I plan to take as 
                                many engineering courses as possible throughout the remainder of my 
                                highschool career. The two that I have already taken not only greatly 
                                interested me, but also did a great deal to broaden my knowledge.

                                During my freshman year in highschool, I took the Project Lead the Way 
                                course Computer Science/Software Engineering and worked diligently to 
                                receive an A in both semesters. It was a very rigorous class that 
                                introduced me to the basics of coding and made me fluent in the 
                                programming languages HTML and CSS and Python. As a final project, we 
                                were instructed to form a group with any set of students and act as 
                                entrepreneurs. Our task was to design a product that we would pitch to 
                                our classes. The top three teams would then move on to participate in 
                                our school’s annual Entrepreneur Competition & Showcase. In our class, 
                                my group placed third for our Water Alarm. It was a prototype of a 
                                product that would be placed on a tap and set to emit audible noises if 
                                someone forgets to fully shut it off and water continues to flow for an 
                                excessive period of time. I helped program the device. For all of my 
                                efforts and evident display of interest in engineering, I was selected 
                                at the end of my freshmen year along with fifty-nine other students to be part 
                                of our school’s engineering academy. The academy provides mentorship 
                                opportunities to us in our junior year and priority into engineering 
                                classes and field trips. As a self-motivated learner, I took a Digital 
                                Art class at Mission College during the summer to get a taste of the 
                                basics of animation. This year I am currently enrolled in the Project 
                                Lead the War course Principles of Engineering, and my experience 
                                continues to be just as enjoyable.

                                In addition to these classes, I joined my schools VEX Robotics Club, 
                                Gael Force Robotics during my freshman year. I started out as a member 
                                on the development team, and even so it was initially incredibly 
                                daunting. Unlike myself, most of my teammates had participated in FIRST
                                Lego League robotics in middle school. They were significantly more 
                                knowledgeable. I was also one of only five girls in the entire club of 
                                over thirty students. However, I remained persistent and as a result 
                                grew substantially as an engineer. The development team taught me a lot
                                of basic engineering principles, as well the importance of 
                                communication skills and teamwork. I started sophomore year again on 
                                the development team, but was offered an internship on a competition 
                                team three months into the school year. After one month of being an 
                                intern, I became an official member of Team 5327C. This entire 
                                experience helped me realize is that although a task may seem initially
                                daunting, with practice and hard work any barrier can be overcome. And 
                                that is the mindset that I intend to bring with me to any difficulty I 
                                am confronted with both at home and at school.
