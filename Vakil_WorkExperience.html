                    As a Dublin High School student, I have had the opportunity to go on many field trips to technical companies and STEM oriented colleges. In addition, several guest 
                    speakers from STEM fields have come in to talk to us during school. These have all been arranged in an effort to get us to think about the 
                    diversity of engineering careers offered and what we may want to pursue in the future. I have 
                    been to one field trip as an Engineering Student. It was the Patriot Jet Team trip during my 
                    sophomore year. This field trip was incredibly memorable because of the fascinating facts that
                    they provided to us, and the engaging demonstrations that they utilized to help us understand concepts.
                    I never knew before that some airplanes could break the sound barrier, going over 760 miles 
                    per hour. To go faster than sound seemed crazy to me. When someone speaks, you can hear them 
                    practically instantaneously. Yet airplanes can go faster than that. In addition, another fact 
                    that in the moment seemed to simultaneously contradict what I have been taught, and yet make 
                    complete sense, was that airplanes have redundant features. At first this seemed like a joke. 
                    In Computer Science/Software Engineering it was drilled into me that redundancies in code are 
                    bad. You want your code to be concise. Yet if you think about it logically, airplanes must be 
                    redundant. They need to have backup plans because if anything goes wrong it can be 
                    life-threateningly dangerous. There must be a fail-safe option. In addition, two things that I
                    had never thought about before, but made complete sense once told to me, were that airplanes 
                    move faster when their external gasoline tanks are pulled in and that aircrafts take off 
                    against the wind. I was able to tie these concepts back to everyday occurrences. Having
                    figure skated before, it makes sense that the airplane moves faster once the gasoline tanks are 
                    pulled in because I spin faster when I pull in my arms. My arms, just like the gasoline tanks,
                    are generally farther from my body to provide stability. In addition, kites take off into the
                    wind. The same aerodynamic principle must also apply to airplanes, as they both fly.

                    From the several guest speakers that I have listened to as an engineering student, I found nuclear 
                    engineer Maynard Holidayâ€™s presentation to be the most fascinating. I had 
                    never heard about the Chernobyl or Fukushima nuclear accidents before. I never even knew that
                    such accidents occurred or that they could be so severe. It is shocking that that the ultra concentrated
                    radiation from the power plants are still potent enough to render robots innefective. Robots are usually sent on dangerous missions because they cannot die like people 
                    do. Yet even robots fail in such toxic environments. It makes you wonder how they are 
                    managing to contain such toxins, and what would have happened if the situations had not been so quickly and professionally taken care of. Although I would 
                    never want to be in such a dangerous job, hearing his stories gave me a sense of immense 
                    respect for the job and science. Both of these experiences were very eye-opening to me.

                    My mentor, Howard Hirano, has also done a great deal to increase my exposure to various engineering disciplines. He introduced me to several of his old coworkers at Lawrence Livermore and Sandia Laboratories. This not only helped me see that countless jobs exist in intersection with the field of engineering, it also helped push me out of my comfort zone and grow more comfortable communicating professionally with people. Howard also provided me with valuable insights on how to approach interview situations. He helped me see that during an interview the candidate is there to assess if the job is right for them just as much as the company is there to determine whether they are a right fit for the group. The interviewers should not be the only ones collecting data from the interaction. An interviewee should always prepare beforehand with notes and questions to maximize what they get out of an interview. Ultimately, Howard gave me numerous tips like these and showed me how to holistically examine my life and the career path that I am shaping for myself. It is a practice that I am very grateful to have learnt, and one that I have now come to use almost subliminally.
