                    For this final CPE 123 project, we were assigned to collaborate in a group of four to create a short animated scene, a small game, or some sort of interactive sketch (details about the project requirements can be found <a href= “Image/final_project_instructions.pdf” id="underline" target="_blank">here</a>). My group decided to create a game together. I came up with the basic concept of the game early on: a car racing game in which the cars can be propelled forward by repeatedly pressing a certain key. It was based on my very first ever coding project (which can be found at the bottom of my high school projects section): a snail race game. My groupmates bought into the concept and added on their own requirements for the game. We decided that a main menu would display first, allowing the user to select from an array of cars. Then the race would take place. Turbos for the cars would be included. I led our meetings by setting up times and dates for Zoom calls outside of class, and then making sure we stayed on task and addressed pending issues methodically during these meetings. I delegated tasks so that everyone had something to work on each week before we came back to report the next meeting. The parts of the game that I was in charge of were: tying the movement of the cars to certain keys, varying the speeds and turbo frequencies of the different cars, programming in the speed reduction if the turbos were pressed out of time, and designing the side profiles of each car in the selection menu. The code for the finished game can be found <a href=https://github.com/Coder6/portfolio/blob/master/cpe123/finalproject.js” id="underline" target="_blank">here</a>. Our professor commented that our project had nice physics and detail. Our thorough work earned us 104%.

                    The objective of this DE project was to design, simulate, and breadboard a control system with six inputs and a clear purpose that used AOI logic. The <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r-VJlRjFO30VUzilyDiigvc9ZesO-aP3T-QR4ORueN4/edit?usp=sharing' id='underline' target="_blank">instructions</a> and <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w4AssDyFyPHwmxf7n_Fj3veP-ElQaDOpF6OL6lq_WGM/edit?usp=sharing' id='underline' target="_blank">rubric</a> further detail all of these requirements. The control system that my partner and I came up with was a “smart” heating device that determined whether or not a building’s heater should be activated given six different inputs: whether someone was at home, whether the temperature was below seventy degrees in the building, whether the current time was in the peak energy time (the time frame when electricity is the most pricey, set by energy distributer companies), whether a window and/or door was open, whether the humidity was below 50% in the building, and whether a person in the establishment had manually turned on the heater. After creating these variables, my partner and I went through each possibility in the truth table together and determined which combinations should cause the heater to turn on. Then, individually, we simplified the function and checked with each other to ensure that our work was correct. After this, I created the multisim simulation for our circuit while my partner breadboarded the device. Through the course of the project we regularly updated our <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X1SkIXY93SVTX8QlBx6Ij9ab_YQL9Xv3og0qA_jZfVg/edit?usp=sharing' id='underline' target="_blank">documentation</a>. Our device and simulation were functional and our documentation was thorough, earning us an A on this project.
