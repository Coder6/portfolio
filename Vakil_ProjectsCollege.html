                    In this first DE project of the year, I was tasked to first find a circuit online to perform a 
                     function of my choice, then breadboard it to prove that it worked as advertised, and finally create a PCB with 
                     soldered components for it. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d_O3fXgzUP6paWxVrQ72PRiIYHiH2W45UY_UEzTZT3M/edit?usp=sharing" id='underline' target="_blank">instructions</a> and <a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_RNQmJGE6F5zTpe6y6RyeiHg96-Vk8J9Np5i4P4kHCc/edit?usp=sharing" id='underline' target="_blank">rubric</a> provided detailed all of these requirements. I opted 
                     to work with a <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/USB-tester/" id='underline' target="_blank">USB port tester</a> circuit that I found on Instructables. To summarize, the circuit had two LEDs 
                     and plugged into a USB port. If the USB port’s polarity was correct, the green LED would light up. If the polarity
                     was reversed (an error that some computers have that can irreplaceably damage USBs), the red LED would light up. And 
                     if no power is received from the USB port, neither LED glows. After breadboarding, I used the software Fritzing 
                     to create my PCB layout. I printed the layout out and ironed it onto a copper plate. I then let it soak in a 
                     ferric chloride bath to react all of the copper except the traces under the ink. Afterwards, I scraped off the 
                     ink to expose the copper and drilled holes for my components. The final step was to solder these components on.
                     My printed circuit board functioned as intended. This project was really creatively engaging, and now I have my
                     own personally made USB port tester! I wrote up <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WLw09WFM7YKdBRItySy4TmpWqn8ajTTCuoPpj9MBavg/edit?usp=sharing" id='underline' target="_blank">documentation</a> detailing my work.

                    The objective of this DE project was to design, simulate, and breadboard a control system with six inputs and a clear purpose that used AOI logic. The <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r-VJlRjFO30VUzilyDiigvc9ZesO-aP3T-QR4ORueN4/edit?usp=sharing' id='underline' target="_blank">instructions</a> and <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w4AssDyFyPHwmxf7n_Fj3veP-ElQaDOpF6OL6lq_WGM/edit?usp=sharing' id='underline' target="_blank">rubric</a> further detail all of these requirements. The control system that my partner and I came up with was a “smart” heating device that determined whether or not a building’s heater should be activated given six different inputs: whether someone was at home, whether the temperature was below seventy degrees in the building, whether the current time was in the peak energy time (the time frame when electricity is the most pricey, set by energy distributer companies), whether a window and/or door was open, whether the humidity was below 50% in the building, and whether a person in the establishment had manually turned on the heater. After creating these variables, my partner and I went through each possibility in the truth table together and determined which combinations should cause the heater to turn on. Then, individually, we simplified the function and checked with each other to ensure that our work was correct. After this, I created the multisim simulation for our circuit while my partner breadboarded the device. Through the course of the project we regularly updated our <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X1SkIXY93SVTX8QlBx6Ij9ab_YQL9Xv3og0qA_jZfVg/edit?usp=sharing' id='underline' target="_blank">documentation</a>. Our device and simulation were functional and our documentation was thorough, earning us an A on this project.
